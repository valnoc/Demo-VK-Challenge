# Demo-VK-Challenge

This is a project created to participate in VK Mobile Challenge.

The task was to create a small application for newsfeed without using any third party library. 
VK SDK could be used only to get access token.

I used 
- Clean Architecture ideas
- Repository pattern
- Background cells' layout calculation (asynchronous UI)
- Codable for JSON parsing
- URLSession for network
- NSCache for image caching
